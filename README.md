# Deep-Learning-Specilaization

All the projects are assignments [the Coursera Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by deeplearning.ai.

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base and diagrams are taken from [the Coursera Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
